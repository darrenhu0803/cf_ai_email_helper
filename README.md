## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "redirect_uri_mismatch" error

**Problem**: The redirect URI in your Google Cloud Console doesn't match.

**Solution**:
1. Go to Google Cloud Console → Credentials
2. Click on your OAuth client
3. Check "Authorized redirect URIs"
4. Make sure it's exactly: `http://localhost:8787/api/oauth/gmail/callback`
   - No `https://`
   - No trailing `/`
   - Exactly `localhost:8787`, not `127.0.0.1:8787`

---

### "Access blocked: This app's request is invalid"

**Problem**: Client ID is missing or incorrect.

**Solution**:
1. Check `email-helper-worker/.dev.vars` file
2. Make sure `GMAIL_CLIENT_ID` is filled in correctly
3. Restart the dev server: Stop (`Ctrl+C`) and run `npm run dev` again

---

### "The app is blocked" or "This app is not verified"

**Problem**: Your app is in testing mode (this is normal!).

**Solution**:
1. This is expected for development
2. Click **"Advanced"** on the warning screen
3. Click **"Go to AI Email Helper (unsafe)"**
4. This only appears for apps in testing mode with your test user account

---

### Emails not syncing

**Problem**: OAuth might have failed or expired.

**Solution**:
1. Go to Settings
2. Check if Gmail shows as "Connected"
3. If not, click "Connect Gmail" again
4. Try "Sync Now" again
5. Check browser console (F12) for any error messages

---

### Can't find `.dev.vars` file

**Problem**: File might be hidden or in the wrong location.

**Solution**:
1. The file should be at: `email-helper-worker/.dev.vars`
2. On Windows, make sure "Show hidden files" is enabled
3. Create it manually if needed:
   ```bash
   # Create the file
   touch email-helper-worker/.dev.vars
   
   # Or on Windows
   type nul > email-helper-worker\.dev.vars
   ```
